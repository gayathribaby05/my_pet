### Next Steps:
1. **Replace Existing Content:** I will check the existing content of `index.html` on GitHub and replace it with the new content if needed.
2. **Uploading the Image:** The image is already hosted online, and we simply need to link to it in the HTML.

I'll proceed to update the content on GitHub with the above HTML.
