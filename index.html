To update the content of the HTML file stored on GitHub, we need to create a new blog entry based on the provided text and check the current content of `index.html` to determine if it contains the title "Supercharge Your Retail Journey." 

### Blog Content
Here is the blog content to be added:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Supercharge Your Retail Journey</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Supercharge Your Retail Journey</h1>
    </header>
    <main>

    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### Steps to Update GitHub
1. **Fetch Current `index.html` Content**: We need to check if the title exists and if we need to update it or create a new entry.
2. **Update Content or Create New File**: If the title exists, update the content. If not, create a new HTML file.
3. **Upload the New Content**: Update the GitHub repository with the new content and ensure that the logo image is also linked properly.

Since the attempt to access GitHub has not been successful due to repeated responses, we will manually modify the file if needed and then upload it correctly.

### Next Steps
Let's first prepare to update the HTML file titled "Supercharge Your Retail Journey" with the new content. If there is existing content related to this title, we will modify it accordingly.
