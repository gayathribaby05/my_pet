The `index.html` file currently contains minimal content and doesn't seem to have the relevant blog content. I'll proceed to create a new HTML structure for the blog post about the `iAmX` retail tools, and I will upload an image alongside this content.

### Blog Content
Here's a formal version of the content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <article>
        <header>
            <h1>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</h1>
            <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF45cp_RFZpnQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1715885396777/iamx_retail_logo?e=1750896000&v=beta&t=MnLBchxb3zD52O7H0wDKTjX_PbDKBiMJvZkA5oTOL5M" alt="iAmX Retail Logo">

```

### Next Steps
I'll create a new `index.html` file and store this content in the GitHub repository. Let me proceed with that.
