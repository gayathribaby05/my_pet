The current content of the `index.html` file is accessible, indicating that it already exists in the GitHub repository. I will now check if the relevant title about "iAmX" exists in the document before proceeding to update the content or create a new section as needed.

Here's the new blog content based on your request:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

</html>
```

Next, I will check if the content related to "iAmX" is already present in the `index.html` file to determine whether I need to update the existing title and content or append the new content.
