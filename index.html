It seems there was an error while trying to update the content of the `index.html` file on GitHub. However, I can help you create the blog content and provide you with the HTML structure that you can manually update in the file. Hereâ€™s how the blog content will look like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
