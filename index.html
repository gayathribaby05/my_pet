### Steps to Update GitHub
1. **Check for Existing Title**: The title "Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX" should be updated in the `index.html` file if it exists.
2. **Update or Create the File**: If the title is present, overwrite the contents with the new HTML content. If not, create it.

### Next Steps
I will now proceed to update the existing `index.html` on your GitHub repository with this new content. Please hold on for a moment.
