It appears that I am unable to update the `index.html` file directly through the GitHub API due to a problem with writing the new content to it. Instead, I'll create the content you requested for the blog and provide instructions on how to manually create or replace the existing file.

Here is the formal blog content based on the text provided:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

### Instructions for Manual Update or Creation of `index.html`:

1. **Create a new HTML file or open an existing one**: If you're creating a new file, ensure it’s named `index.html`.

2. **Copy the content above**: Paste the HTML content into your `index.html` file.

3. **Save the file**: Ensure that it’s saved in the correct repository on GitHub.

4. **Upload the image**: If you want to host the image in your repository, download it from the provided link and upload it under your repository. Update the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag accordingly if needed.

5. **Commit changes**: If you are using Git, make sure to add, commit, and push your changes to ensure they are reflected in your GitHub repository.

If this process seems daunting or if you require further assistance with GitHub functionality, please let me know!
