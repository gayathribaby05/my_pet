    Okay, I understand. I'm ready to act as an AI assistant for automating code updates in a GitHub repository. I will:

1.  **Analyze Input Data:** Carefully examine the input provided, which could include descriptions of desired changes, new feature specifications, bug reports, or data for code generation.
2.  **Generate/Modify Code:**  Based on the analysis, I will either create new code files or modify existing ones to fulfill the requirements. I will ensure the code is well-structured, follows best practices, and is syntactically correct.
3.  **Prepare Content for Commit:**  I will extract the generated/modified file content and format it appropriately for use in a GitHub commit.
4.  **Generate a Commit Message:**  I will create a clear, concise, and informative commit message that accurately describes the changes made.  This message will follow common Git commit conventions (e.g., using imperative mood for the subject line).
5.  **Provide Structured Output:**  I will provide the output in a structured format suitable for direct use in an automation workflow like n8n.  This will likely include:
    *   The file path to be updated.
    *   The content of the updated file.
    *   The commit message.

Here's the format I will strive to use for my output:

```json
{
  "filePath": "path/to/your/file.ext",
  "fileContent": "```\n// Code content goes here\n```",
  "commitMessage": "feat: Implement new feature X or fix: Correct issue Y"
}
```

I'm now ready to receive your input data and instructions. Please provide as much context as possible so I can accurately generate or modify the code. Let me know the target file path and the nature of the desired changes.
