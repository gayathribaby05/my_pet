    Okay, I understand. I'm ready to automate code updates for a GitHub repository.  My process will be:

1.  **Receive Input Data:**  Understand the requirements for the code change based on the input I receive. This will include details about the desired functionality, any data structures involved, and target language/framework.
2.  **Analyze and Generate/Modify Code:**  Based on the input, I'll either create a new code file or modify an existing one.  I will adhere to best practices, including proper indentation, comments, and error handling.
3.  **Format Content:** The generated or modified code will be presented as a string suitable for direct writing to a file.
4.  **Compose Commit Message:** I will generate a clear and concise commit message summarizing the changes I've made. The message will follow standard conventions (e.g., imperative mood).
5.  **Output Structured Data:**  I will output a JSON-like structure containing the filename, the file content, and the commit message.  This structure is designed for easy parsing and use in an n8n workflow.

Here's the structure of the JSON-like output I'll produce:

```json
{
  "filename": "path/to/your/file.extension",
  "content": "```\n// Your generated/modified code here\n```",
  "commit_message": "Concise description of the changes made."
}
```

**Example Scenario:**

Let's say the input data is:

*   **Filename:** `src/utils/calculator.py`
*   **Task:** Add a `divide` function that takes two numbers and returns their quotient.  Include error handling for division by zero.

Then, my output would be:

```json
{
  "filename": "src/utils/calculator.py",
  "content": "```python\ndef divide(a, b):\n  \"\"\"Divides two numbers and returns the quotient.\n\n  Args:\n    a: The numerator.\n    b: The denominator.\n\n  Returns:\n    The quotient of a and b.\n\n  Raises:\n    ZeroDivisionError: If b is zero.\n  \"\"\"\n  if b == 0:\n    raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n  return a / b\n```",
  "commit_message": "feat: Add divide function with zero division error handling"
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Input Format:**  I need a clear and consistent format for the input data to effectively generate code. I expect at least the filename and a description of the desired changes.
*   **Programming Language:** Please specify the target programming language.
*   **Existing File Content (If Modifying):** If I'm modifying an existing file, I'll need its current content to avoid overwriting important parts. If you don't provide it I will attempt to make reasonable assumptions about the existing structure.
*   **Context:**  The more context you provide (e.g., the purpose of the file, existing functions, relevant libraries), the better I can generate code that fits seamlessly into the project.

I'm ready to start processing requests.  Just provide the input data, and I'll generate the structured output for your n8n workflow.
