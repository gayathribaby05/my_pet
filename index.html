The `index.html` file already exists in the GitHub repository. I will check its content and update it with the new blog entries if it contains any relevant sections regarding the title. Let me retrieve and check the existing content of the file. 

The current content is encoded in base64:

```
QWdlbnQgc3RvcHBlZCBkdWUgdG8gbWF4IGl0ZXJhdGlvbnMu
```

Decoding this will give us the actual text, and then I can decide what to do next. Let's decode it now. 

The decoded content is:

This content does not appear to include any relevant sections or titles regarding iAmX. Therefore, I will place the new blog content into `index.html`.

Hereâ€™s the structured blog content I will save:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
