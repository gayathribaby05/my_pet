### Steps to Update or Insert the Content 
1. **Check Existing Content**: Since the `index.html` file already exists in the repository, we will need to check if the title "Enhance Your Retail Journey with iAmX" is present.
   
2. **Update or Create**: 
    - If the title is found, update the content of the existing HTML to the new blog content provided above.
    - If the title is not found, overwrite the existing content with the new HTML, which contains the blog content on iAmX.

3. **Upload Image**: The provided image URL can be used directly in the HTML. However, if you want to upload this image directly into the repository, you would need to download it and then use the GitHub API to upload the image file.

### Next Steps
- Should I proceed to update the index.html file on GitHub with the new content, or should I handle the image upload as well? Let me know how you would like to proceed!
