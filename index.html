The current content of the `index.html` file in your GitHub repository already contains some text related to your blog. It seems like we need to update the blog content with the new formal content you provided. 

Here's how we will rewrite the HTML content to include the new formal text along with an image. The updated content will be as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>iAmX Retail Journey</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to iAmX</h1>
    <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF45cp_RFZpnQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1715885396777/iamx_retail_logo?e=1750896000&v=beta&t=MnLBchxb3zD52O7H0wDKTjX_PbDKBiMJvZkA5oTOL5M" alt="iAmX Retail Logo">

```

I will now update the `index.html` file in your GitHub repository with this new content. Let's proceed with this update.
