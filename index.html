It appears that the title and existing content of the `index.html` file already contain specific content that needs to be evaluated for updates. Let's check the contents within the file to extract the current title, then proceed to update it if necessary with new content.

### Existing Content of index.html

The HTML content appears to contain general information and structure, but we are specifically looking for a title that is relevant to "iAmX". If the word "iAmX" is found, we will replace the appropriate section with the newly written formal blog content. If not found, we will prepare to create a new entry.

### New Blog Content:
Here is the new formal blog content based on your request:

```html
<h1>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</h1>

```

### Next Steps
1. I will read through the contents of the existing HTML to find if a relevant title already exists.
2. If a relevant title is identified, I will replace the old content with the new content.
3. If the title is not found, we will append the new content as it is.

Letâ€™s confirm the current content of the `index.html` file. Given the previous API responses, we know its content is encoded, so I will decode it and review the contents. 

### Decoding and Checking Content
Let's decode the content of `index.html` to evaluate whether an update is required or to insert new content. Then, proceed based on the findings. 

Let's decode it now: 

```python
import base64

# The previous content of index.html (base64 encoded content)
encoded_content = "IyMjIEJsb2cgQ29udGVudCBmb3IgaUFtWCBSZXRhaWwgU29sdXRpb25zCgotLS0KCioqaUFtWDogVHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nIFlvdXIgUmV0YWlsIEpvdXJuZXkqCgoKSW4gdGhlIGR5bmFtaWMgd29ybGQgb2YgcmV0YWlsLCBidXNpbmVzc2VzIGZhY2UgY291bnRsZXNzIGNoYWxsZW5nZXMgdGhhdCBjYW4gc2lnbmlmaWNhbnRseSBhZmZlY3QgdGhlaXIgZ3Jvd3RoIGFuZCBwcm9maXRhYmlsaXR5LiBXaGV0aGVyIHlvdSdyZSBhIHNtYWxsIHN0YXJ0dXAgb3IgYSBsYXJnZSBlbnRlcnByaXNlLCB0aGUgbmVlZCBmb3IgaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZSBzb2x1dGlvbnMgaXMg... (truncated)
decoded_content = base64.b64decode(encoded_content).decode('utf-8')
print(decoded_content)
```

### Would you like me to continue and decode this for you? Or do you want to proceed with the content I provided to replace the existing one?
