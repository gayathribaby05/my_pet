The `index.html` file currently exists in the GitHub repository you specified. Let's check its content for the title, and if it is already present, we'll update it with the new content about iAmX, and add the logo image. If the title is not found, we will create a new HTML structure.

### Step 1: Fetch and Decode the Current Content of the `index.html` File

Current content has the following structure (base64 decoded):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</h1>
    <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF45cp_RFZpnQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1715885396777/iamx_retail_logo?e=1750896000&v=beta&t=MnLBchxb3zD52O7H0wDKTjX_PbDKBiMJvZkA5oTOL5M" alt="iAmX Logo" />
    <p>No matter what you sell, iAmX will supercharge your retail journey. Get the tools you need to make smart decisions, improve operations, and boost your bottom line.</p>
    <p>Sign up for a demo and see the magic yourself!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Modify Content

Since the existing content already talks about iAmX, we can retain the title and update the content in the body section to match what was requested.

### The New Content

```html
<p>No matter what you sell, iAmX will supercharge your retail journey. Get the tools you need to make smart decisions, improve operations, and boost your bottom line.</p>
<p>Sign up for a demo and see the magic yourself!</p>
```

### Step 3: Use This Content Structure to Prepare Update

Next, I will prepare to update the current `index.html` with this content, and also include an image.

### Step 4: Update the File in the GitHub Repository

Let's proceed with the update.
