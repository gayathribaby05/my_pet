The content of the existing HTML file `index.html` already contains some structured content based on a previous submission. You need to update that with new formal blog content. Here's the content that we will write into the file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>

Now, I will proceed to update the index.html file with this new content.
