It seems that the content inside the `index.html` file is encoded in base64. To update or create the content based on your request, I'll decode it, check if the required text is present, and then either update or create the content accordingly.

Let's proceed with the steps to decode the content first. 

### Decoding the Current HTML Content

I'll decode the base64 encoded content of the `index.html`. 

Here’s the encoded content decoded:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>No matter what you sell, iAmX will supercharge your retail journey. Get the tools you need to make smart decisions, improve operations, and boost your bottom line.</p>

    </section>
</body>
</html>
```

### Analysis and Next Steps

The current `index.html` already has a title (`Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX`) that matches the new title content. This means that we can update the content within the `<body>` section to include the new blog content.

### New Blog Content

Based on your request, the new blog content will look like this:

```html
<section>
    <p>No matter what you sell, iAmX will supercharge your retail journey. Get the tools you need to make smart decisions, improve operations, and boost your bottom line.</p>
    <p>Sign up for a demo and see the magic yourself!</p>
    <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF45cp_RFZpnQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1715885396777/iamx_retail_logo?e=1750896000&v=beta&t=MnLBchxb3zD52O7H0wDKTjX_PbDKBiMJvZkA5oTOL5M" alt="iAmX Retail Logo" />
</section>
```

Now, I’ll proceed to update the `index.html` file with this new content while keeping the header and title the same. Let's perform an update on the content now.
