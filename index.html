It appears that I encountered a problem while trying to update the content in your GitHub repository. The `index.html` file currently holds the encoded representation of the content, which suggests that it may not be created or modified correctly based on the prompts you provided.

**Here's the blog content based on your input:**

### Next Steps
1. **Manual Update**: You may use the above content to manually update the `index.html` file in your GitHub repository.
2. **Re-checking**: You can explore the repository on GitHub to locate and edit the file directly through the web interface.
3. **Troubleshooting**: Consider ensuring that the GitHub token used (if any) has sufficient permissions to modify the repository.
