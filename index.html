### Steps to Implement

1. **Title Check**: The title "Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX" was not previously present in the existing `index.html`.
2. **Creating New File**: Since the title was absent, a new HTML file containing the specified content was created.
3. **Image Inclusion**: The specified logo from the provided URL has been included as a favicon.

### Next Steps

The new HTML content can now be uploaded to the GitHub repository. Would you like me to proceed with that, or do you want to make any changes to the content before uploading?
