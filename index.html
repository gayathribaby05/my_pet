### Next Steps:
1. **Update or Create the Index File**: 
   - If "index.html" already contains the content, I will update it with the new blog content.
   - If it does not contain it, I will create the file with the new content and the logo.

**Would you like me to proceed with the update or creation of the file in GitHub?**
