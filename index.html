It appears that the title is already present in the `index.html` file. I will now extract the existing content, make the necessary updates with the new blog content, and include the image you provided. The updated HTML content will be structured formally and include a header, an image, and the main content.

Here's the planned update for `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</title>
</head>
