To update the existing `index.html` file in your GitHub repository with new content, follow these steps:

1. **Check if the Title is Present**:
   Since the title already exists in the file, we will update the content.

2. **Prepare New Content**:
   Here’s the new content based on your request:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> <!-- Assuming you have a CSS file -->
   </head>
   <body>
       <header>
           <h1>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</h1>
       </header>
       <section>

       </section>
       <footer>
           <p>&copy; 2023 iAmX. All rights reserved.</p>
       </footer>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Upload the Updated File**:
   The HTML file has to be updated on GitHub with the new content.

Here’s how you can go about executing these changes in the GitHub repository:

1. For updating the existing `index.html`:
- Use GitHub API to push new content directly to your existing file using the SHA for that file to ensure you're updating the correct one.

Let's proceed to update the `index.html` file with the new content now.
