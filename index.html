You can update the contents of `index.html` with the above HTML structure. However, currently, I'm unable to make the changes to the repository due to API restrictions. 

To create or update this yourself, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone your repository if you haven't already.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a code editor.
3. Replace the existing content with the HTML structure provided above.
4. Save your changes and commit them back to the repository.

If you need further assistance with updating the GitHub repository or if you'd like me to guide you through more specific steps, let me know!
