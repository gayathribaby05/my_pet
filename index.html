The contents of the `index.html` file on your GitHub repository already exist. Below is the new blog content that will replace the current content in `index.html`:

### New Blog Content:

        h1 {

2. The image of the iAmX logo will be included as specified.
3. Once confirmed, I will proceed to update the `index.html` file in your GitHub repository.
