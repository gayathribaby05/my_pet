I have retrieved the existing `index.html` file from the GitHub repository. To update the content with the new information about iAmX and its services, I will first check if a section with the same title exists in the HTML file. If it does, I'll update that section with the new content. If not, I will create a new HTML segment.

Next, I'll also include the specified image in the HTML content. Here's how the new blog content will look:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        .content {
            margin: 20px;
        }
        img {
            max-width: 100px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="content">

    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

I will update the existing file on GitHub with this new content. Let's proceed with the update.
