To create and update the blog content for the project "iAmX," we will follow these steps:

1. **Check Existing Content**: We will check the contents of the `index.html` file to see if the title is already present.
2. **Update or Create Content**: If the title is found, we will replace the existing content with the new content. If not, we will create a new entry.
3. **Add an Image**: We will include the provided image link in the blog content.
4. **Upload the Changes**: Finally, we will save the updated or new content back to the `index.html` file on GitHub.

**Blog Content**:
