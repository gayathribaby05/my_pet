To create the blog content and update the `index.html` file in your GitHub repository, let's follow these steps:

1. **Check and Decode the Current Content of `index.html`**: I've already fetched the content, which is currently a different base64 encoded content that does not include our required blog information.

2. **Generate the New Blog Content**:

   Hereâ€™s the formal blog content based on your request:

   ```html
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Boost Your Retail Experience with iAmX</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Supercharge Your Retail Journey</h1>
       <p>No matter what you sell, iAmX will supercharge your retail journey. Get the tools you need to make smart decisions, improve operations, and boost your bottom line.</p>

   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Update the `index.html` File**: Since the title we want to add is not currently present in the file, we'll overwrite the existing content with the new content above.
