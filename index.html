### Instructions

1. **Check Existing Content**: Since the file already exists, we need to check whether the new title is present.
   
2. **Update or Create**: If the title already exists, update the content with the new HTML. If not, store the new HTML in the `index.html`.

3. **Hosting the image**: The image link provided should be embedded correctly in the HTML to ensure it is displayed on the webpage.

### Next Steps

I'll proceed to check the content of `index.html` in your GitHub repository, and if the title doesnâ€™t match, I'll update the file with the new content. If it matches, the content will be refreshed based on the new input required. 

Now I will perform this task and provide the update accordingly.
