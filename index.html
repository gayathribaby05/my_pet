It seems that the content of the `index.html` file on GitHub has not changed, but I can provide you with the new blog content to be added or updated. Hereâ€™s the content based on your requirements:

### Next Steps
1. **Check for Title**: Check the `index.html` on GitHub to see if the title exists as specified.
2. **Update or Create File**: Update the existing `index.html` if the title is found; otherwise, create a new file.
