It appears the file `index.html` is already present in the GitHub repository. Let's check its content for a suitable title to determine whether we need to update it with the new blog content. 

The existing content (decoded) is as follows:

```
The blog content has been successfully updated in the @index.html file of your GitHub repository. Here's a brief overview of the content that includes the title and an encouraging message to sign up and explore iAmX.
```

Now, I'll create the new blog content and the necessary HTML structure. If the title is present, I will update it; otherwise, I'll create a new entry. I'll also prepare to add the provided image to the HTML content. Here's the formatted blog content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Supercharge Your Retail Journey with iAmX</h1>

Now, let's proceed to update the existing `index.html` file with this new content.
