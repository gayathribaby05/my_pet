### Additional Notes:
- The HTML file has been updated without any errors and is now live on your GitHub repository.
- The logo image was not added directly into the HTML content here, but you can specify the image link in the HTML as needed. Here's how to include it:
  
```html
<img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF45cp_RFZpnQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1715885396777/iamx_retail_logo?e=1750896000&v=beta&t=MnLBchxb3zD52O7H0wDKTjX_PbDKBiMJvZkA5oTOL5M" alt="iAmX Retail Logo" />
```
